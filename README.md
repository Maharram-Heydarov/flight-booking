# Plane Ticket Booking Console Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a Java console application for booking plane tickets from Kiev. The application allows users to search, book, and manage flight reservations in an interactive console-based interface. The system follows a structured three-layer architecture (Controller, Service, DAO) and ensures data persistence through file storage.

## 🚀 Features
- **Online-board**: View available flights from Kiev within the next 24 hours.
- **Flight Information**: Retrieve details of a specific flight by entering its ID.
- **Search & Book a Flight**: Find flights based on destination, date, and number of passengers, then proceed with booking.
- **Cancel Booking**: Cancel an existing flight reservation by entering the booking ID.
- **My Flights**: Retrieve all bookings associated with a passenger's full name.
- **Exit**: Close the application while saving all changes.

## 🏷️ Architecture
The project follows the standard three-layer architecture:
- **Controller Layer**: Handles user input and directs requests to the service layer.
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic and interacts with the DAO layer.
- **DAO Layer**: Manages data persistence using text/binary files.
